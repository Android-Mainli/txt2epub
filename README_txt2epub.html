<h1>txt2pub</h1>

Version 0.0.1, March 2017

<h2>What is this?</h2>

<code>txt2epub</code> is a command-line utility for Linux,
for converting one
or more plain text files into an EPUB document. It will insert the
standard author/title meta-data, and can include a cover image.
Limited formatting is possible using Markdown-style markup,
or full XHTML. 
<p/>
This utility is intended as a quick way to covert books provided
as plain text into a format that can be handled more easily by 
e-readers. Although most portable devices that might be used
for reading can handle plain text perfectly well, the
lack of meta-data or a cover image makes collections of
such documents unwieldy.
<p/>
Although it is not its main function,  
<code>txt2epub</code> can be used with a plain text editor
to produce a commericial-quality EPUB novel, 
that will pass most publishers' validation checks. However, 
books that have complex formatting, or embedded images, 
need a more sophisticated approach. 


<h2>Example usage</h2>

<pre class="codeblock">
txt2epub\ -o\ dickens_great_expectations.epub \
   --author\ "Dickens,\ Charles"\ --title\ "Great\ Expectations" \ 
   gex1.txt\ gex2.txt\ gex3.txt
</pre>

Convert files gex1.txt, etc., into an EPUB document, setting the 
author and title meta-data appropriately. Each file with receive an
entry in the table of contents. 


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

The only external runtime dependencies are on the standard 
linux <code>zip</code>
utility, and the PCRE regular expression parsing library. Both
should be available in the repositories of most Linux distributions. 
<p/>
<code>txt2epub</code> will probably build and run on other
Linux-like systems, but this has not been tested. 


<h2>Building and installing</h2>

The usual:

<pre class="codeblock">
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>Markdown support</h3>

Unless it is disabled (<code>--ignore-markdown</code>), <code>txt2epub</code>
processes a small set of markdown-type formatting markers:

<pre class="codeblock">
#This is a heading
##This is a subheading
###This is a subsubheading
This is _italic_. This is *bold*
</pre>

A line that ends in two spaces (which may not be visible at all in a text
editor) is terminated with a line-break. This is a simple way to
include pre-formatted text.
<p/>
These markdown constructions are turned into basic HTML 
tags (not style classes).

<h3>XHTML support</h3>

Any text files supplied to 
<code>txt2epub</code> are just inserted into the body of an XHTML 
document, as this is the presentation format that EPUB specifies.
It follows that files can contain XHTML markup if necessary.
XHTML is a stricter standard than HTML, and many ordinary HTML files will not
pass muster -- a typical problem is not closing tags, or using
the wrong letter case in tags.
<p/>
Providing XHTML can be useful for heavily formatted pages such as a
title page or dedication. However, the files provided should
<i>not</i> be full XHTML files --   
<code>txt2epub</code> will write the proper XHTML header and footer.
Instead, just provide the body text.
<p/>
Many commercial e-readers use existing HTML rendering software to 
display text; in such cases you might get away with using ordinary
HTML. However, it isn't strictly correct, and won't pass a
publisher's validation checks.
 

<h3>Input text formatting issues</h3>

E-book text files tend to be formatted in one of three ways:

<ul>
<li>One very long line per paragraph</li>
<li>Variable-length lines with blank lines to indicate paragraph breaks</li>
<li>Variable-length lines with no blanks; paragraph breaks are indicated
by white-space intended lines</li> 
</ul>

<code>txt2epub</code> attempts to handle the third type by treating any
line that starts with three or more whitespace characters as a paragraph
break. Because some files that are formatted as variable-length lines
end up with spaces at the start of each line, this behaviour can be
turned off using <code>--ignore-indent</code>.

<h3>stdin</h3>

<code>txt2epub</code> will read from standard input (stdin) if
a minus sign (-) is used for the filename.  


<h3>Cover image support</h3>

The switch <code>--cover-image</code> can be used to provide the EPUB
document with a leading cover page. This image is presented as a single-page
image without any annotation, at the start of the book. EPUB guidelines 
suggest that a cover image should be 590 pixels wide by 750 high. No
check is made that the image meets this guideline -- it is simply
copied into the EPUB. An error message will be shown if the image file
does not exist, but the EPUB will still be created.
<p/>
The EPUB specification states that images files must be in JPEG, GIF,
SVG, or PNG formats. 
<code>txt2epub</code> will install images of any type but, as with
wrongly sized images, EPUB viewers vary in their willingness to 
display them. 

<h2>Bugs and limitations</h2>

<code>txt2epub</code> presently does not remove unnecessary byte-order
markers and similar encoding detritus from text files. 
<p/>
Users should be wary of using constructions like "book*.txt" to include
many files. While Linux shells usually present files in alphanumeric order,
subtleties like locale and collation settings can modify this.
<p/>
Files created by this utility will not necessarily pass the validation
in  
<code>epubcheck</code> 
because the "mimetype" file is not always the first in the archive. This
can be fixed if it causes problems with readers; so far it has not.
<p/>
<code>txt2epub</code> does not write a "guide" section in the 
NCX table-of-contents. This is optional and, so far as I know, no EPUB
reader takes much notice of it.
