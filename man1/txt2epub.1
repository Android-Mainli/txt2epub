.SH NOTES

.SS Character encoding 

EPUB documents are required to be encoded in UTF-8. This is the default
on most Linux and Unix platforms, but there are many encoding standards
in use. A strict ASCII file can be treated as UTF-8 without modification,
but the same cannot be said for the many 8-bit "extended ASCII" 
character encodings that are in use.
\fItxt2epub\fR will not attempt to change, or even guess, an input file's
encoding. If it is not UTF-8, results will be variable. On Linux,
the  
\fIiconv\fR 
utility can be used to change character encoding. For example, to 
convert from ISO8859-1:

.nf
.B iconv\ -f\ iso8859-1\ -t\ utf8\ {input_file}\ >\ {output_file} 

.SS Table of contents 

\fItxt2epub\fR does not write a visible contents page in
the EPUB document. However, it does write an internal "NCX" 
table-of-contents, that most readers support (and, in many cases,
insist on). Each text file specified on the command line gets
an entry in the table-of-contents, even if there is only one
input file. 

.SS Input formatting

Input is assumed to consists of lines or aribtrary length, with
paragraph breaks signalled either by a blank line, or an indent
of three or more whitespace characters. Because some documents that
have blank-line paragraphs have lines that accidentally start
with spaces, the use of indents as paragraph breaks can be
turned off (--ignore-indents)

By default, 
\fItxt2epub\fR respects simple Markdown-style formatting marks,
like _italic_ and *bold*. This behaviour can be turned off
using --ignore-markdown. 

.SH BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No check is made that the input file really is text, or even that 
any of the input files actually exist. Any input file that does not
exist results in a book chapter whose text is an error message.

Users should be wary of using constructions like "book*.txt" to include
many files. While Linux shells usually present files in alphanumeric order,
subtleties like locale and collation settings can modify this.
